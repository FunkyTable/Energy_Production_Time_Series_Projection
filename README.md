# Readme should include (Copied from Assignment Objectives):

Ideally, your README should include:

1. A **project title**
    * Choose a title that reflects the project domain and presents you as a data scientist, not as a student. The title should not include words like "capstone" or "school"
    * Some title formats to consider:
       * "Predicting `target`"
       * "`target` Prediction"
       * "`target` Detection"
       * "Classifying `target`"
       * "`target` Recommender"
       * etc.
    * Feel free to add "with `data`" or "using `data`" to the end of any of those. For example, *Detecting Fake Reviews with NLP* or *Classifying Skin Lesions Using Neural Networks*
    * You also might want to start the title with a catchy phrase or quote, followed by a more-standard title. For example, *Where To, First?: an Airbnb Destination Predictor* or *Stay in Your Lane! Automated Bike Lane Enforcement*
      * You can always add this element later, so don't get hung up on it if you can't think of something right away! Just start with the straightforward title
2. An **elevator pitch**
    * Immediately after the title, write a very short description of the problem you are solving, the data you are using to solve it, and how well your model solves the problem
    * This should be no more than a couple of sentences
3. A **header image**
    * This image can be anything you want, so long as it is professional and aligns with your project
    * Ideal dimensions are 1280x640 pixels, but any image with landscape orientation (wider than it is tall) will work
    * Image sourcing ideas to consider:
      * Use a stock image from a source like [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
         * Make sure you double-check the usage license and attribution requirements
      * Create visualizations with code (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
      * Take your own photo
         * This is most relevant if you have a real-world connection to the domain
    * As a reminder, the Markdown notation for an image is `![alt text](path/to/image.png)`
4. **Business Understanding and Data Understanding**
    * Explain the project context, using at least one citation to demonstrate your domain understanding
    * Consider including visualizations here as well
5. **Modeling and Evaluation**
    * What kind of model(s) did you use?
    * How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline?
6. **Conclusion**
    * How would you recommend that your model be used?
7. **Repository Navigation**
    * An explanation of the repository organization
    * Links to the final notebook and presentation
       * As a reminder, the Markdown notation for a link is `[link text](/path/to/file)`
    * Reproduction instructions (or a link to them)

The best practice would be to include all of the items listed above in your README. Items 2 and 7 are particularly relevant for grading, as described below.
